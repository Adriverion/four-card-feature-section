## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- responsive design 

### What I learned

I have learned a more complete use of custom properties and the clamp() function, I have also adopted a mobile first way of working as a practice, besides how much the exercise made it easier for me, finally I have become familiar with the units of relative measures, I am still a beginner in this respect but I am happy with the final result.

### Useful resources

- [Utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/) - tool that helped me to create the measures for the clamp property
